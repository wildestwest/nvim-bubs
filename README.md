# kickstart.nvim

## Introduction

My take on NVIM, based on kickstart but there is not too much left of that

includes lsps for:
- python
- rust
- zig
- go 
- bunch of other small stuff like json and yaml and helm

## Installation

### Install Neovim

Kickstart.nvim targets *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on the platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

### Install Kickstart

> **NOTE**
> [Backup](#FAQ) your previous configuration (if any exists)

Neovim's configurations are located under the following paths, depending on your OS:

| OS | PATH |
| :- | :--- |
| Linux, MacOS | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`, `~/.config/nvim` |
| Windows (cmd)| `%localappdata%\nvim\` |
| Windows (powershell)| `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\nvim\` |

#### Recommended Step

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repo
so that you have your own copy that you can modify, then install by cloning the
fork to your machine using one of the commands below, depending on your OS.

> **NOTE**
> Your fork's URL will be something like this:
> `https://github.com/<your_github_username>/kickstart.nvim.git`

You likely want to remove `lazy-lock.json` from your fork's `.gitignore` file
too - it's ignored in the kickstart repo to make maintenance easier, but it's
[recommended to track it in version control](https://lazy.folke.io/usage/lockfile).

<details><summary> Linux and Mac </summary>

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wildestwest/nvim-bubs.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

</details>

<details><summary> Windows </summary>

If you're using `cmd.exe`:

```
git clone https://github.com/wildestwest/nvim-bubs.git "%localappdata%\nvim"
```

If you're using `powershell.exe`

```
git clone https://github.com/wildestwest/nvim-bubs.git "${env:LOCALAPPDATA}\nvim"
```

</details>

### Post Installation

Start Neovim

```sh
nvim
```

That's it! Lazy will install all the plugins you have. Use `:Lazy` to view
the current plugin status. Hit `q` to close the window.

It could take a sec to install all the lsps I use

#### Read The Friendly Documentation

Read through the `init.lua` file in your configuration folder for more
information about extending and exploring Neovim. That also includes
examples of adding popularly requested plugins.

> [!NOTE]
> For more information about a particular plugin check its repository's documentation.
